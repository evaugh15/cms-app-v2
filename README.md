# CMS Application Information & Installation Processes

Welcome to the CMS Application. The CMS Application is designed to help you better manage your IT organization. The application constructed in conjunction with Kennesaw State University and by: Ethan Vaughn, Devon Smith, Dim Cabore, Helen McDaniel, and Muftau Salami.

## Getting Started

- We have included a file that explains the separate installations and how to get the project up and running. **Please click here to view.**
- Install most current version of [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
- Run `npm i` in the project directory to install project dependencies. Important installations include: **mongoose, express, @angular/cli@latest.**
- Any updates of code that are pushed to `main` will be auto-deployed to the Heroku application (https://cms-test-app-gtri.herokuapp.com/home).

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
